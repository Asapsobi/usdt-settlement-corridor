// DefaultInterval is how often RunLoop checks for newly-ingested blocks
// to scan for candidates and re-checks finality, when Interval is unset.

// for candidates faster than new blocks can possibly have been ingested.

// maxBlocksPerTick bounds how many blocks runTick's own ScanRange call
// covers at once, regardless of how far behind lastCandidate has
// fallen -- see this constant's own call site for why. Real-traffic
// testing against a public provider's own 20000-result cap on the real
// USDT_BEP20 contract found even 200 blocks intermittently too wide (the
// contract's own Transfer volume varies enough by time of day that a
// fixed block count is an imperfect proxy for log count); 100 blocks
// (~5 minutes of BSC block production) left real margin against THAT
// cap. A second real run (10 Sep 2026) found free providers enforcing a
// much stricter, hard per-call BLOCK-RANGE ceiling regardless of result
// count, and that ceiling varies by provider: 1rpc.io's own free tier
// allows 50 blocks, Alchemy's free tier allows only 10. Lowered to 10 to
// clear the tightest of these with no margin to spare -- a deployment
// paying for a provider with a higher cap on every dimension could
// raise this.

// ahead of chain.LastScannedHeight -- ingestion's pre-final-reorg check
// for a height must have already happened before this package trusts a
// log found there) but that this package has not yet scanned for
// Transfer logs, then checks finality once. Blocks until ctx is
// cancelled, returning ctx.Err().
//
// Progress is persisted via chain.SetCandidateScannedHeight, so a
// restart resumes near where it left off rather than replaying the
// entire chain. A brand new cursor (first boot, column still NULL)
// starts from the CURRENT ingested height, not genesis -- there is no
// value in a fresh deployment trying to candidate-scan years of history
// it was never running to observe live.
