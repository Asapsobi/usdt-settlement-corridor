// Package requests is S1's own external contract: SigningService, the
// interface C5 calls. It supersedes the synchronous Sign() call
// c5-payout-dispatcher-build-prompts.md originally proposed -- see
// docs/02-architecture/s1-key-custody-architecture.md's own "The
// SigningService interface needs one real change: it can't stay
// synchronous" for why. A human-approval decision can take minutes to
// hours; blocking a single call on that is either a broadcast attempted
// against a half-finished flow or a spuriously failed dispatch attempt
// for an order that would have gone through fine five minutes later.
// This package reuses the shape energybroker's own reservations.Service
// already proved for exactly this problem: PENDING, polled until a
// terminal state.
