# Shared build for every Go module in this repo (ledger/, depositwatcher/,
# screening/, energybroker/, dispatcher/, s1/, proofrun/) -- one Dockerfile,
# parametrized by build args, rather than seven near-identical copies.
# Written for docs/03-build/mvp-proof-run-plan.md's own stack; NOT exercised
# against a real Docker daemon while writing it (this session's own
# environment has no Docker installed) -- verify `docker compose build`
# succeeds before relying on this for the actual proof run.
#
# MODULE_DIR: the module's own directory, e.g. "ledger", "dispatcher".
# SERVER_BIN: the cmd/ subdirectory under MODULE_DIR to build as the
#   server binary, e.g. "ledgerd", "dispatchd".
# HAS_MIGRATE: "true" for every module with its own cmd/migrate (all of
#   them except proofrun, which owns no database).
