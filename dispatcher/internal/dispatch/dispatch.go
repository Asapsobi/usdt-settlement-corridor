// EnterDispatching posts the E2 conversion entry and transitions order

// slotID is whichever slot C5.1/C5.2's own selection already committed
// to for this dispatch -- EnterDispatching does not choose a slot, only
// records the choice.
//
// occurredAt is supplied by the caller, not computed here, and MUST be
// stable across every retry of this same logical attempt (including a
// fresh process after a crash) -- discovered against a real ledgerd: the
// conversion entry's own idempotency-key replay check compares a hash of
// the full payload, occurred_at included, so a retry that recomputes
// time.Now() produces a different hash and is rejected as
// idempotency_conflict rather than replayed. There is no natural external
// timestamp for "when C5 decided to dispatch this order" the way E1 has
// the deposit's own block time, so the caller owns picking one value once
// (e.g. when it first selects a slot for this order) and supplying that
// same value on every subsequent call -- the same determinism C5.4's own
// BuildTransfer is required to have, for the same reason.
//
//   - On 409 version_conflict: refetch the order once and retry with its
//     current version. If the order is already `dispatching` (this exact
//     call already succeeded and C5 simply didn't observe the response),
//     the retry lands on C1's own replay path -- (dispatching,
//     dispatching) is not a legal transition pair, but an identical
//     entry payload under the same idempotency key replays instead of
//     erroring (ledger/internal/orders/store.go's own
//     replayIfAlreadyPosted). A second version conflict after the retry
//     is returned as an error, per invariant 6's "retry once" -- anything
//     racier than that is a caller bug, not a condition this function
//     papers over.
//   - On 423 system_halted: this transition is halt-blocked in C1 by
//     design (unlike C4's own energy-cost entries). Back off and retry
//     indefinitely on HaltBackoff -- never treated as a failure requiring
//     C5.7's dispatch-failure handling; ctx cancellation is the only way
//     out of this loop.
